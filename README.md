The classic game of hangman is back. This project represents the full MEAN stack: MongoDB is used to add player comments to the website. 
Express and Node help run the Mongo database, and Angular / Express work in tandem to search for a server-side random word for each new game.
On the front end, users can select a catagory in which to play the game. 

To launch the program, go to git and type node server.js to spin up the server. Go to a browser and type: localhost:3000.

This project was created by John Worlton and Fahad Tariq in an advanced web development course at Utah Valley University.
